# Dotao

WIP! I'm focusing a lot on this project, it is on early stage of development.

Not ready for personal use yet, will break your stuff.

# Scracth:

# How it works:
Dotao is a dotfiles manager that considers groups of dotfiles, and links it to the user home.

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
dotao i3/
```
or
```
dotao */ # All directories, all groups
```

Now the files inside of the i3 group are linked in your user home.

# Choices
The whole behavior of the linking process will be customizable with flags and a .tree/.dotman-tree file, more on that later

# Documentation
Just to tell you, there's a lot left to document
